# Solutions and reference solvers

Every challenge package includes a short organizer writeup and a working reference solver:

```text
challenges/<mode>/<category>/<slug>/solution/
├── README.md            # required concise writeup
├── solve.py             # required simple Python solver
├── requirements.txt     # optional exact direct pins
├── assets/              # optional referenced screenshots or freezed figures
└── fixtures/            # optional small redacted inputs
```

Start from [`templates/solution.md`](templates/solution.md) and
[`templates/solve.py`](templates/solve.py). AI agents apply the same contract through
`$rsctf-challenge-solution`.

## Repository and player boundary

The solution files are tracked organizer material. Anyone with Git read access can see them.
Keep a real pre-event challenge repository access-controlled, or retain an unpublished
solution in a separate restricted store. The solutions in this example repository are
deliberately disclosed demonstration material.

Repository access is not player delivery. Never copy `solution/` into `dist/`, a `src/`
Docker context, generated content, an observer bundle, or a blind-playtest room. Do not store
live flags, reusable credentials, organizer tokens, production targets, or unredacted secrets
in a solution or its screenshots.

## README.md format

Keep these headings and order:

1. `# <Challenge name> solution`
2. `## Verification record`
3. `## Summary`
4. `## Player inputs`
5. `## Walkthrough`
6. `## Why it works`
7. `## Solver`
8. `## Evidence`
9. `## Notes`

Write plainly. A teammate should understand the intended path without reading the solver
first. Keep each exploit stage chronological:

1. observation available to the player;
2. hypothesis supported by that observation;
3. exact action or command;
4. genuine visible result; and
5. capability or information gained.

Put author-source explanations under `Why it works`. Do not use hidden source, a solver
constant, or organizer knowledge to justify an earlier player decision. Use exact commands,
trim long output, and preserve the mode's prefix when redacting: `rsctf{...}` for normal
flags and `flag{...}` for A&D. Link the complete `solve.py` instead of pasting a shorter
second implementation into the writeup.

When a package is intentionally illustrative, such as the current `DynamicAttachment`
example, say that it is unplayable and show the expected nonzero solver result. Never invent a
successful solve to fill the template.

## solve.py format

The solver should be the smallest clear implementation of the intended player path.

- Use `#!/usr/bin/env python3` and a short module docstring.
- Put the exploit or calculation in `solve()`.
- Keep `main()` to argument parsing, one call, concise output, and exit status.
- Prefer the Python standard library. If a dependency materially improves clarity, pin its
  exact direct version in `requirements.txt`.
- Accept explicit player inputs such as `--url`, `--host` and `--port`, `--input`, or a
  current KotH token. Do not hard-code author machines, production targets, live flags,
  hidden routes, container names, or organizer APIs.
- Bound timeouts, reads, brute-force ranges, retries, subprocesses, and output.
- Validate success and exit nonzero on failure. Catch only errors that can be explained more
  clearly; do not hide bugs with `except Exception`.
- Use context managers for files, sockets, and HTTP responses.
- Avoid classes, frameworks, configuration layers, generic retry engines, plugin patterns,
  banners, emoji, and debug modes unless the challenge itself genuinely requires them.
- Keep a normal solver well under 100 lines. Complexity belongs only where the exploit needs
  it.

The README command and solver interface must match exactly. Compile and run it before review:

```sh
python3 -m py_compile challenges/<mode>/<category>/<slug>/solution/solve.py
python3 challenges/<mode>/<category>/<slug>/solution/solve.py <documented arguments>
```

## Screenshots and freezed

Use screenshots only when they prove a visual state or make a source relationship easier to
understand than text. A plain HTTP, TCP, JSON, or file challenge normally needs genuine
terminal output instead.

Store referenced images under `solution/assets/`. For each image, record the route or command,
identity, prerequisite state, UTC capture time, and the fact it proves. Capture the exact
revision through the correct player or organizer boundary. Never mock a UI, hand-type terminal
output, or edit source before rendering it.

Use `freezed` for an annotated figure of real source:

```sh
freezed path/to/source.py \
  --lines 20,45 \
  --show-line-numbers \
  --window \
  --theme github-dark \
  --padding 20 \
  --margin 26 \
  --title 'player-visible/path/to/source.py' \
  --arrow 'vulnerable_call(user_input)' \
  -o solution/assets/vuln-input-flow.png
```

Use one `--arrow` to point to one region and repeated `--mark` options for a numbered sequence
of related regions. Select code by quoted text when practical, and keep the selection inside
the range passed to `--lines`. An internal organizer writeup may show author source but must
label it author-only. A player-facing publication may show only source the player receives or
earns.

Open every generated image at readable scale. Check clipping, line visibility, stale source,
wrong identity, tokens, flags, production hosts, and unrelated personal data. Regenerate it
after the source changes.

## Draft and frozen states

Every verification record starts as `draft`. Change it to `frozen` only when all of these refer
to the same committed revision:

- full Git commit SHA;
- challenge type and delivery mode;
- handout SHA-256 or image identity when applicable;
- exact backend and redacted target shape;
- UTC test time and reviewer;
- exact successful solver command and redacted output;
- every retained screenshot and its reproducible command; and
- applicable checker, generator, flag-rotation, KotH, BYOC, or observer evidence.

Any change to behavior, player copy, solver, or retained evidence returns the writeup to
`draft`. A working solver proves mechanics. A separate blind playtest proves discoverability
and informs difficulty.
